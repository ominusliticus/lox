# Lox Hacker Language
This repository holds my implementations of the [Lox programming language](https://craftinginterpretors.com).
It is my attempt to breaking into the compiler world.

## Interpreter
There are two folders, the first containing the code for the Lox interpreter.
This follows the second part of the book.

## Compiler
The third part of the book has details on writing a compiler.

## Looking forward
Part of the goal here is to start with Lox language and add some language features to it such as template programming and meta programming.
